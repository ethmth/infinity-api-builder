# Infinity API Builder

CODE ADAPTED FROM [HERE](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zZ3cUJWGDjT4mtq2rohfHID9ffONhqfL?usp=sharing)


Create the API application [here](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) with the following settings:

- name: `{YourRedditUsername}s-app` (Replace {YourRedditUsername} with your actual username)
- type: `Installed app`
- redirect uri: `http://127.0.0.1`

Example:
![Example](https://i.ibb.co/TkvjQgW/grafik.png)

The API token is then shown at the bottom of the page under the App name ("{YourRedditUsername}s-app") and is a set of random characters (e.g. 6g5ZHEGEAnKHP3vewUFY3y)

Input the API token and your username and run.
Leave redirect_uri as it is if you don't know what it is.
